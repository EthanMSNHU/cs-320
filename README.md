How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  Conducting the proper tests and getting outside sources to test and read the code is a good way to make sure your project or software is functional and secure. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
  Me personally I will take what is provided to me for the user needs and wants then after that I will take on the role of the user and think about what I would personally want and need from the software. Doing this allows me to think outside of the box in terms of what the users want and need apart from what is provided to us from the assignments. 

How do I approach designing software?
  My approach to designing software is looking at the requirments and the bare minmum of what is required of me.I also try my best to practice the industries best practices. Those are a good start for designing. Afterwards I like to look at the design and see what quality of life changes I can add on or change but still upholding the goal and functionality of the system.
